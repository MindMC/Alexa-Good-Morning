# Alexa-Good-Morning

This skill allows you to customize Alexa's response using a csv file.  You can set the greeting and then the order of items you want to hear when you open the skill.

Currently you can select from these items: todo, traffic, weather, forecast, humidity, pressure, astronomy, surf, quake, air, news, stocks, quote, joke or cat.

The todo and traffic require a separate csv file.

I have also included an addition modules.  These items require you to register for an API key to use those services.

If you have other useful or fun API's, please let me know.
